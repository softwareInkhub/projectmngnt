# 🔍 Quick Debug Steps - Find the Cookie Issue

## 🚀 Step 1: Restart Dev Server
```bash
cd /home/nikhil/brmh/projectmngnt
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
npm run dev
```

## 🌐 Step 2: Visit Debug Page
```
Open: https://projectmanagement.brmh.in/debug-auth
```

**Note:** This page bypasses authentication so you can always access it.

You should see a page showing:
- Auth Cookie Status
- All visible cookies
- localStorage data

## 📋 Step 3: Check Initial State
**Look at the debug page and note:**
- How many cookies are shown?
- Are any auth cookies present?

## 🔐 Step 4: Test Login
1. **On debug page, click: "🔐 Test Login Flow"**
2. You'll go to auth.brmh.in login page
3. **Login with your credentials**
4. **You'll be redirected back to /debug-auth**

## 👀 Step 5: Trigger Middleware & Check Logs

**After logging in and being redirected back:**

1. **Try to visit the dashboard:**
   ```
   https://projectmanagement.brmh.in/dashboard
   ```

2. **Look at your terminal where dev server is running.**

You should see logs like this:

```
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] ==================
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] Auth check for: /debug-auth
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] URL: https://projectmanagement.brmh.in/debug-auth
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] All cookie names: ['cookie1', 'cookie2', ...]
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] Has id_token: true/false
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] Has access_token: true/false
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] Has refresh_token: true/false
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] Total cookies: X
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] Cookie: id_token = eyJ...
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] Cookie: access_token = eyJ...
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] Has ANY token? true/false
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] ==================
```

## 📊 Step 6: Report Findings

### ✅ **If Middleware Sees Tokens (Has ANY token? true)**
**Copy and send:**
1. Terminal logs showing "Has ANY token? true"
2. Terminal logs showing "🍪 Set auth_valid cookies"
3. Debug page showing auth_valid status

**This means:** Middleware is working, but client-side might have an issue.

### ❌ **If Middleware Sees NO Tokens (Has ANY token? false)**
**Copy and send:**
1. Terminal logs showing "Total cookies: 0" or low number
2. Terminal logs showing "Has ANY token? false"
3. Browser DevTools → Application → Cookies screenshot

**This means:** auth.brmh.in is not setting cookies properly OR cookies aren't being sent with the request.

## 🔍 Step 7: Check Browser Cookies
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to: **Application → Cookies → projectmanagement.brmh.in**
3. Look for these cookies:
   - `id_token`
   - `access_token`
   - `refresh_token`
   - `auth_valid`
   - `auth_valid_local`

**Take a screenshot and share it.**

## 🎯 Quick Test Commands

### In Browser Console (projectmanagement.brmh.in):
```javascript
// Check what JavaScript can see
console.log('All visible cookies:', document.cookie);
console.log('Has auth_valid:', document.cookie.includes('auth_valid'));
```

### Check Application Tab:
```
DevTools → Application → Cookies → .brmh.in
(Check if cookies are there but not being sent)
```

## 📤 What to Send Me

**Please copy and paste:**

1. **Terminal Middleware Logs** (the full ======= section)
2. **Debug Page Auth Status** (screenshot or copy the "Auth Cookie Status" section)
3. **Browser Cookies** (screenshot of DevTools → Cookies)
4. **Console Output** (from the JavaScript commands above)

## 🤔 What I'm Looking For

### Scenario 1: Cookies in Browser but Middleware Can't See Them
```
Browser DevTools: Shows id_token, access_token ✅
Middleware Logs: Total cookies: 0 ❌
→ Problem: Cookies not being sent with request
```

### Scenario 2: No Cookies Anywhere
```
Browser DevTools: No cookies ❌
Middleware Logs: Total cookies: 0 ❌
→ Problem: auth.brmh.in not setting cookies
```

### Scenario 3: Middleware Sees Cookies but No auth_valid
```
Middleware Logs: Has id_token: true ✅
Middleware Logs: 🍪 Set auth_valid cookies ✅
Debug Page: auth_valid: ❌ Missing ❌
→ Problem: Response cookies not being set
```

## ⚡ Quick Reset (If Needed)
```
On debug page, click: "🗑️ Clear All Auth Data"
Then refresh and try login flow again.
```

**Ready to test!** Follow steps 1-7 and send me the outputs. This will help me identify exactly where the cookie flow is breaking! 🎯
