# 🔧 Debugging Setup Complete!

## What I've Done

I've added extensive debugging tools to help identify why `auth_valid` cookies aren't being set.

### ✅ Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Middleware Logging** (`middleware.ts`)
   - Added detailed cookie logging
   - Shows ALL cookies received from browser
   - Shows token detection status
   - Logs every cookie name and value (first 50 chars)

2. **Created Debug Page** (`/debug-auth`)
   - Shows all cookies visible to JavaScript
   - Shows localStorage data
   - Has "Test Login Flow" button
   - Has "Clear All Auth Data" button
   - **Always accessible** (bypasses auth check)

3. **Created Documentation**
   - `AUTH_DEBUG_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Detailed debugging guide
   - `QUICK_DEBUG_STEPS.md` - Step-by-step testing guide
   - `DEBUGGING_SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - This file

## 🚀 What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Restart Dev Server
```bash
cd /home/nikhil/brmh/projectmngnt

# Stop current server (Ctrl+C if running)
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Follow Quick Debug Steps
```bash
# Read this file:
cat QUICK_DEBUG_STEPS.md

# Or open it in VS Code
```

### Step 3: Test & Report
1. Visit: `https://projectmanagement.brmh.in/debug-auth`
2. Click "Test Login Flow"
3. Login at auth.brmh.in
4. After redirect, check:
   - Debug page cookie status
   - Terminal middleware logs
   - Browser DevTools cookies

### Step 4: Send Me the Logs

**I need to see:**
1. **Terminal output** - the middleware logs (copy the `========` sections)
2. **Debug page screenshot** - showing cookie status
3. **Browser DevTools** - Application → Cookies screenshot

## 🔍 What We're Looking For

The enhanced logs will show us EXACTLY what's happening:

### Scenario A: Middleware Sees No Cookies
```
Terminal shows:
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] Total cookies: 0
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] Has ANY token? false
```
**Meaning:** auth.brmh.in is not setting cookies, OR cookies aren't being sent with request.

### Scenario B: Middleware Sees Tokens
```
Terminal shows:
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] Has id_token: true
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] Has access_token: true
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] ✅ User authenticated
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] 🍪 Set auth_valid cookies
```
**Meaning:** Tokens are present, auth_valid should be set. If debug page still doesn't show them, there's a cookie-setting issue.

### Scenario C: Cookies in Browser but Not in Request
```
Browser DevTools shows: id_token, access_token ✅
Terminal shows: Total cookies: 0 ❌
```
**Meaning:** Cookies exist but aren't being sent with requests. Possible SameSite/domain issue.

## 📋 Quick Reference

### Access Debug Page
```
https://projectmanagement.brmh.in/debug-auth
```

### Check Middleware Logs
```
Look at terminal where `npm run dev` is running
Search for: [ProjectMngnt Middleware]
```

### Check Browser Cookies
```
F12 → Application → Cookies → projectmanagement.brmh.in
```

### Test Login Flow
```
On debug page, click: "🔐 Test Login Flow"
```

### Clear Everything
```
On debug page, click: "🗑️ Clear All Auth Data"
```

## 🎯 Expected Output After Login

### If Working Correctly ✅

**Middleware Logs:**
```
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] ==================
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] Auth check for: /dashboard
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] All cookie names: ['id_token', 'access_token', 'refresh_token']
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] Has id_token: true
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] Has access_token: true
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] Total cookies: 3
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] Cookie: id_token = eyJhbGc...
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] Cookie: access_token = eyJhbGc...
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] Has ANY token? true
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] ✅ User authenticated via cookies, allowing access
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] 🍪 Set auth_valid cookies (both .brmh.in and local domain)
[ProjectMngnt Middleware] ==================
```

**Debug Page:**
```
📋 Auth Cookie Status
id_token: ❌ Missing (expected - httpOnly)
access_token: ❌ Missing (expected - httpOnly)
refresh_token: ❌ Missing (expected - httpOnly)
auth_valid: ✅ Present
auth_valid_local: ✅ Present
```

**Browser DevTools:**
```
Cookies for projectmanagement.brmh.in:
✅ id_token (httpOnly: Yes, domain: .brmh.in)
✅ access_token (httpOnly: Yes, domain: .brmh.in)
✅ refresh_token (httpOnly: Yes, domain: .brmh.in)
✅ auth_valid (httpOnly: No, domain: .brmh.in)
✅ auth_valid_local (httpOnly: No, domain: projectmanagement.brmh.in)
```

### If Not Working ❌

**Any of these could indicate a problem:**
- Middleware logs show 0 cookies
- Debug page shows all ❌ Missing
- Browser DevTools shows no cookies
- Middleware doesn't log "🍪 Set auth_valid cookies"

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Run the test** (follow QUICK_DEBUG_STEPS.md)
2. **Collect the logs** (terminal + debug page + devtools)
3. **Send them to me** so I can see exactly what's happening

The enhanced logging will tell us:
- Are cookies being set by auth.brmh.in? ✓
- Are cookies being sent to projectmanagement.brmh.in? ✓
- Is middleware seeing the cookies? ✓
- Is middleware setting auth_valid cookies? ✓
- Are auth_valid cookies visible to client? ✓

Once I see the logs, I'll know exactly where the flow is breaking and can fix it! 🎯
